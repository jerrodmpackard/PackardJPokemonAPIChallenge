Pokemon API Challenge
Created a Pokedex web app, allowing the user to search for a Pokemon from generations 1-5 and receive data about that Pokemon from the Pokemon API. Includes the ability to search by Pokemon name or Pokedex number in addition to a random button that returns a random Pokemon. Default and shiny images are available as well as description, type, location, abilities, moves, and evolutions. Allows the user to save Pokemon to a favorites list using local storage.
