Pokemon API Challenge
Created a Pokedex web app, allowing the user to search for a Pokemon from generations 1-5 and receive data about that Pokemon from the Pokemon API. Includes the ability to search by Pokemon name or Pokedex number in addition to a random button that returns a random Pokemon. Default and shiny images are available as well as description, type, location, abilities, moves, and evolutions. Allows the user to save Pokemon to a favorites list using local storage.

Peer review comments: Has a clean layout and responsiveness is on point. One thing I noticed was that if the input field is empty and if the search button is clciked right after the random button, it displays "undefinded". Apart from that the search, favorites, and random buttons work as intended. The favorites functions works based of the local storage status. User's are able to toggle between "normal" and "shiny" version. The evolution function only works if the pokemon has an evolution pathway of three. Overall, it was greatly designed and fufills almost all the requirements. Great work as always!
